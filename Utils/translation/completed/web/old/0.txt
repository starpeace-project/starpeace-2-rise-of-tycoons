"Founded by the wealthiest organizations in Europe, PGI provides some of the best technologies available today. Regardless of your level, if you seek efficiency and quality PGI is the way to go.<p>PGI industries are efficient and showcase the best production quality available, but its facilities are very expensive. PGI is the only Seal allowed to produce Paper and Printing Materials in the new worlds. Chemicals, clothing, residentials and commerce centers are its strength."

"Very efficient industries, with the best production quality available."
"High prices. Industries are too big sometimes."

"Weakest areas"
"Chemicals, clothing, residential buildings, stores and other commerce centers."
"None known this far."
"Introduced by Markus Blomke—founder of the IFEL—to balance the colonies’ political landscape, most of the Dissident technology was designed to be ideal for beginners.<p>Dissidents’ buildings sport very low prices, however the production quality is low and the efficiency level is not the best available. Dissidents have the exclusivity on the production of Liquors, Toys and Wood. Best performance is in farming, software, bars and media."
"Very low prices. Low levels of pollution. Small designs ideal for low populated areas."
"Low quality of production. Low efficiency. Archiquecture is sometimes awkward."
"Farming, software, bars and media."
"Residentials buildings, mining, metalurgic and heavy industries."
"Mariko Enterprises offers highly competitive solutions based on the knowledge developed by the Japanese in the last century.<p>Since Mariko Industries are highly automated, they need fewer workers and are very efficient. Their smaller structures are relatively low priced and guarantee less pollution. Plastic production and CDs are reserved to the Mariko Seal. Its strongest business areas are electronic components, lawyers, offices, household appliances and business machines."
"Low levels of pollution. Industies highly automated. High levels of efficency. Relatively low prices."
"Low resistance to crime and pollution. High automation can increase unemployment."
"Electronic components, lawyers, office buildings, household appliances and business machines."
"Food processing, residentials buildings and media."
"A religious order, the Moab was founded in Texas by a wealthy German immigrant. The Moab is a state of mind that can only be achieved by a sadomasochist ritual revealed only to those who embrace the cult.<p>Thanks to the centralization of all the civic buildings in the Correctional, this seal is the best in fighting crime and fire. Moab has the exclusivity of the oil-gas production chain: oil rigs, refineries and gas stations; the best mining and chemicals; good high and low class residentials."
"Great crime and fire fighting. Very efficient industries. Moderate prices."
"Dark and sometimes frighting designs.	Some people don't like to work in Moab industries. It has been told that strange murders occur in their residential buildings."
"The best mining and chemicals in the world. High class and low class residentials."
"Middle class residentials and media. Farming and food processing methods are suspicious."

"Action takes place in the near future. Earth is on the verge of collapse. Overpopulation and the abuse of nature have run, a once green planet, dry. First World countries are getting ready to go to war against Third World countries, hoping this will alleviate the situation."
"As an alternative to that, the IFEL (International Foundation for Extraterrestrial Life) offers a revolutionary program, code named <b>Legacy</b>."
"IFEL's view"
"IFEL controls portals of mysterious origin. These portals are used to populate the new worlds."
"Earthlings can apply for an IFEL visa and find a new life in one of these worlds. Those outstanding individuals who qualify are granted a special kind of visa: the Investor Visa. Investors receive 100 million dollars from IFEL to develop these colonies. <b>You can be one of them.</b>"
"The Seal"
"A select few companies in the world can match the versatility and power required to win an IFEL Seal."
"The Seal allows a company to provide technology solutions to investors. Current Seal Owners are: PGI, Mariko Enterprises, Dissidents Inc, The Moab and Magna."
